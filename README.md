# MCS51-Course
Intel MCS51 Mocrocontroller (AT89C51) course in Assembly language. This course provides an introductory material for programming AT89C51 microcontrolles 

PG1.A51
GENERATE THE BINARY PATERN IN INCREASING ORDER ON THE LEDs CONNECTED AT PORT1
SET THE INCREASING SPEED OF 2 COUNTS PER SECOND.

PG2.A51
GENERATE THE BINARY PATERN IN INCREASING/ DECREASING ORDER WHEN THE USER PRESSES
THE BUTTONS AT P2.2/ P2.3. THE LEDs ARE CONNECTED AT PORT1. SET THE COUNTING
SPEED OF 2 COUNTS PER SECOND.


PG3.A51
MOVE A SINGLE LED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT AND RIGHT TO LEFT ON THE P1. SET THE
MOVING SPEED OF 4 COUNTS PER SECOND.

PG4.A51
GENERATE THE 7 SEGMENT CODES OF HEXADECIMAL NOMBERS IN INCREASING ORDER ON THE
LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIGIT OF 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY. SET THE INCREASING SPEED OF 1
COUNT PER SECOND. USE CODE MEMORY FOR SEGMENT CODES.

PG5.A51
GENERATE THE CLOCK PULSES OF 30 Hz AT P1.0 BY USING TIMER 0.


PG6.A51
DISPLAY THE CONSTANT NUMBER 1234 ON THE 4 DIGIT 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY BY USING
TIMER.

PG7.A51
DISPLAY 16 BIT HEXADECIMAL NUMBER ON THE 4 DIGIT 7 SEGMENT WITH INCREASING
SPEED OF 20 COUNTS PER SECOND USING TIMER0

PG8.A51
DISPLAY 16 BIT HEXADECIMAL NUMBER ON THE 4 DIGIT 7 SEGMENT WITH INCREASING OR
DECREASING SPEED OF 20 COUNTS PER SECOND USING BUTTONS AT P2.1 OR P2.2


PG9.A51
ENTER THE 7 SEGMENT CODE ON 4 DIGIT 7 SEGMENT DISPLAY WHEN A KEY IS PRESSED
ON THE HEX KEYPAD. THE CODE OF A NEW KEY SHOULD BE ENTERED FROM RIGHT SIDE OF
THE DISPLAY AND THE PREVIOUS DATA WILL ALSO BE SHIFTED.

PG10.A51
RECEIVE THE SCAN CODE COMING FROM THE ATKEYBOARD AT P3.6(CLK) AND P3.7 (DATA)
DISPLAY THE BINARY PATERN OF THE SCANE CODE ON THE LEDs

PG11.A51
TRANSMITT THE ASCII CODES FROM A TO Z CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH SERIAL PORT OF
89C51.USE THE BAUD RATE OF 9600 BPS.


PG12.A51
TRANSMIT THE ASCII CODES OF KES IN THE PROGRAM PG9.A51 ON SERIAL PORT USING
THE BAUD RATE OF 9600 BPS. (SUPPOSE THE CRYSTAL FREQUENCY IS 11.0592 MHz.)


PG13.A51
TRANSMIT THE ASCII CODES OF KES IN THE PROGRAM PG9.A51 ON SERIAL PORT USING
THE BAUD RATE OF 9600 BPS. (SUPPOSE THE CRYSTAL FREQUENCY IS 11.0592 MHz.)
